<h2>Standard Outline Format</h2>

<p><u>Purpose</u>:  The purpose of an outline is to identify the most important ideas in one or more chapters of a textbook and organize them according to their importance.</p>

   <ol class="primary">
       <li><u>Roman</u> Numerals are used to identify the biggest and most important ideas. If you are outlining more than one chapter, then you will usually use roman numerals to identify the chapter titles.  If you are only outlining one chapter then you will use roman numerals to identify section headings.</li>
       <br> 
       <ol class="secondary">
            <li><u>Main Ideas</u> are identified by capital letters.  In the textbook that we use the main ideas are all in red bold letters. Every time you see a heading that is big and red
                    you will write it down with a capital letter to the left of it.</li>
            <ol class="tertiary">
                <li><u>sub-headings</u> are smaller parts of a main idea. They are identified by numbers. In our text book, most subheadings are green.  Sometimes, however, there arenâ€™t any subheadings.  In that case you will write the first sentence of a paragraph as a subheading.</li>
                <ol class="quaternary">
                        <li>supporting details are usually examples, proper nouns or numbers.  They are identified by lower case letters.</li>
                        <li>supporting details are usually examples, proper nouns or numbers.  They are identified by lower case letters.</li>
